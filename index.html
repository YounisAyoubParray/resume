      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you've seen my professional background, let me share a little about what keeps me energized outside of work.
      I'm Younis Ayoub Parray, and my hobbies are an essential part of who I am. From a young age, cricket has been one of my greatest passions — not just for the thrill of the game, but for the lessons it has taught me about teamwork, strategy, and discipline.
      But when I’m not on the cricket field, I find excitement in PC gaming. It's where I challenge my mind with problem-solving, explore different virtual worlds, and connect with a global community. And for balance, I love to trek through the mountains — getting outdoors and immersing myself in nature is my way to unwind, disconnect, and recharge.
      These hobbies are more than just pastimes; they help me stay grounded, creative, and always striving to improve, both personally and professionally.
